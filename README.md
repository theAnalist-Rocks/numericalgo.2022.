# numericalgo.2022.https://github.com/theAnalist-Rocks/numericalgo.2022.

This is a repo that contains algorithms such as:
    # solving f(x) = 0 with Newton's method, Steffensen's and so on ...
    # solving linear equations such as Ax=b where A is a (n*n) matrix
    # interpolation with Newton's method, Lagrangian interpolation
    # solving differential equations with Runge-Kutta's method, Euler's etc
